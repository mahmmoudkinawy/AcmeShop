## Technologies that used : 

### Asp.net Core 5.0 | MSSQL | Angular 10 ... etc

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.

## Development server for API

Run `dotnet run` for a dev server. Navigate to `https://localhost:5001/api/products`.

## In case of client server we must write the follwoing URL `https://loalhost:4200` notice that it's `https` not `http` because I used Security Certificate which is valid for 2040

## Development server for front end

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `https://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
